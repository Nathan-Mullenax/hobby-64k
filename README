What is it?

It's an extensible virtual machine, assembler, and (eventually) a compiler. The idea is to create a semantically dense instruction set to allow non-trivial programs to be squeezed into the 64k format. Toward this end, up to 2^16 user instructions can be defined, and each of these instructions is 4 bytes long: 2 bytes to identify the command, and 2 bytes for the argument. New instructions can be defined at compile-time or at run-time, using the 'lambda' instruction.
